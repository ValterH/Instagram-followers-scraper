# Instagram-followers-scraper
Script that returns a JSON file of Instagram followers for specified inputs.  
*The program is slow since [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/) has a limited number of requests and therefore it sometimes needs to wait an hour to keep running*  

Requirements: [selenium module](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)

To run the script:   
-open the Command Prompt  
-move to the directory of the project  
-run command: find_followers.py -u "YOURIGUSERNAME" -p "YOURIGPASSWORD" -q "USERNAME1, USERNAME2, USERNAME3..."  
*example command provided in [example.txt](https://github.com/ValterH/Instagram-followers-scraper/blob/master/example.txt) (however those tags would take a very long time to process)*
